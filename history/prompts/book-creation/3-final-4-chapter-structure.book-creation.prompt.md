# Prompt History Record: Final 4-Chapter Structure Implemented

## Original Prompt
Finalize the book structure to include only 4 specific chapters: Introduction to Physical AI, Fundamentals of Humanoid Robotics, Machine Learning Applications in Robotics, and Hardware and Software Architectures. Remove all references to other chapters.

## Response Summary
Successfully finalized the project with only the 4 required chapters:

1. Specification alignment:
   - specs/book-creation/spec.md contains only the 4 required content areas
   - specs/book-creation/plan.md references only the 4 chapters
   - specs/book-creation/tasks.md includes tasks only for the 4 chapters

2. Content implementation:
   - Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
   - Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Humanoid Robotics
   - Chapter 3: Machine Learning Applications in Robotics
   - Chapter 4: Hardware and Software Architectures
   - Overview and glossary documents created

3. Docusaurus configuration:
   - my-website/sidebars.ts properly configured for 4 chapters
   - Navigation structure reflects the 4-chapter organization
   - All content follows specification-driven approach

## Outcome
The project now contains exactly 4 chapters as requested, with no additional content or references to other chapters. All specifications, plans, tasks, and implementations are aligned to this structure.

## Follow-up Actions
- The 4-chapter book is ready for further development and refinement
- All future content should align with these 4 specified chapters only
- The project follows the specification-driven approach as outlined in the constitution
