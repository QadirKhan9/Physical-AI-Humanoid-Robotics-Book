# Specification: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Objective
Create a comprehensive technical book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using a specification-driven workflow with AI collaboration. The book should be educational, technically accurate, and accessible to beginners while covering advanced concepts.

## Overview
This specification defines the requirements for creating a complete technical book about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The book will be developed using a spec-driven approach where each chapter/module begins with a detailed specification, followed by implementation using AI assistance.

## Core Requirements

### Content Scope
- Introduction to Physical AI concepts
- Fundamentals of humanoid robotics
- Machine learning applications in robotics
- Hardware and software architectures

### Technical Requirements
- Output format: Docusaurus-compatible Markdown
- Consistent structure across all chapters
- Modular design allowing individual chapter updates
- Cross-references between related concepts
- Code examples where applicable
- Diagrams and illustrations (described in text)

### Quality Standards
- Technical accuracy verified through authoritative sources
- Beginner-friendly explanations with progressive complexity
- Consistent terminology and formatting
- Proper attribution and citation of sources
- Regular fact-checking and updates

## Structure Requirements

### Chapter Template
Each chapter must follow this structure:
```
# [Chapter Title]
## Overview
[Brief introduction to the chapter topic]

### Concepts
[Key concepts explained in detail]

### Steps
[Practical steps or procedures if applicable]

### Examples
[Real-world examples or code samples]

### Summary
[Key takeaways from the chapter]

### Exercises
[Practice problems or thought experiments for readers]
```

### Technical Issues Section Format
Each technical topic must include:
- **Inputs**: What data/information is required
- **Outputs**: What results are produced
- **Architecture**: System design overview
- **Code**: Implementation details (if applicable)
- **Failure Modes**: Potential issues and how to address them
- **Safety Notes**: Important precautions

## Deliverables

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Complete specification for all book chapters
- Template system for consistent formatting
- Style guide and terminology reference

### Phase 2: Content Creation
- Individual chapter specifications
- Draft content for each chapter
- Technical review and validation

### Phase 3: Integration
- Full book assembly from individual chapters
- Cross-reference linking and consistency check
- Final review and publication preparation

## Success Criteria
- All chapters completed according to specification
- Consistent tone, style, and formatting throughout
- Technical accuracy validated
- Deployable to GitHub Pages via Docusaurus
- Positive feedback from target audience (beginners to intermediate learners)

## Constraints
- No hallucinated facts or technologies
- Content must be based on current research and industry practices
- All external sources properly cited
- Adherence to the established constitution and guidelines

## Dependencies
- Access to authoritative sources on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
- Tools for creating diagrams and illustrations
- Docusaurus deployment infrastructure

## Timeline
- Specification phase: 1 week
- Content creation: 4-6 weeks depending on depth
- Review and integration: 1 week
