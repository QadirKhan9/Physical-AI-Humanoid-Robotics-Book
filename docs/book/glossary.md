# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a robot that converts energy into physical motion. Common types include servo motors, stepper motors, and hydraulic/pneumatic actuators.

**Anthropomorphic**: Having human-like characteristics in form or behavior. In robotics, refers to robots designed with human-like physical features.

## B

**Balance Control**: Systems and algorithms that maintain a robot's stability, particularly important for bipedal robots that must maintain equilibrium while walking or standing.

**Bipedal Locomotion**: The ability to walk on two legs, a key capability for humanoid robots to navigate human environments.

## C

**Control Theory**: The mathematical study of how to influence the behavior of dynamical systems. Essential for robot motion control and stability.

**Cognitive Architecture**: The structure and organization of intelligent systems, including how they process information, make decisions, and learn.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent movements a mechanical system can make. A human arm has 7 DOF, providing dexterous manipulation capabilities.

**Dynamics**: The study of forces and torques that cause motion. In robotics, dynamics models predict how robots move in response to applied forces.

## E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators, as opposed to purely digital AI systems.

**End Effector**: The tool or grasping device at the end of a robotic arm. For humanoid robots, this is typically a hand designed for manipulation tasks.

## F

**Forward Kinematics**: The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot's end effector based on the joint angles of its arm.

**Force Control**: Control strategies that regulate the forces applied by a robot, important for safe interaction with humans and delicate objects.

## G

**Gait**: The pattern of leg movements used for locomotion. For humanoid robots, gait control is essential for stable walking.

**Gyroscopic Effect**: The tendency of a rotating object to maintain its axis of rotation. Used in balance control for humanoid robots.

## I

**Inverse Kinematics**: The process of determining the joint angles needed to achieve a desired position and orientation of a robot's end effector.

**Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, used for balance and orientation in robots.

## K

**Kinematics**: The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. Forward and inverse kinematics are fundamental to robot control.

## L

**Locomotion**: The ability to move from one place to another. For humanoid robots, this typically refers to walking, running, or climbing.

## M

**Manipulation**: The ability to handle or control objects with the hands or other end effectors. A key capability for humanoid robots.

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: An advanced control method that uses a model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions.

## P

**Physical AI**: A field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems, enabling AI systems to interact with and control physical environments.

**Perception System**: The components of a robot that process sensory information from the environment, including vision, touch, hearing, and proprioception.

## R

**Robot Operating System (ROS)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

**Redundancy**: In robotics, having more degrees of freedom than necessary to perform a task, providing flexibility in motion planning and obstacle avoidance.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to improve the accuracy and reliability of environmental perception.

**Stability**: The ability of a robot to maintain balance and continue operating without falling or losing control.

## T

**Torque Control**: Control strategies that regulate the rotational force applied by actuators, important for precise motion control in humanoid robots.

**Trajectory Planning**: The process of determining the path a robot should follow to move from one position to another while satisfying constraints.

## W

**Whole-Body Control**: Control strategies that coordinate all parts of a humanoid robot simultaneously, considering balance, manipulation, and other tasks together.
